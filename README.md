CMPT276-Assignment-1 

First assignment for CMPT276 course at SFU, Spring 2022.

Required to create basic average grade calculator (with weighting option) using HTML and CSS for templating, and Javascript for the actual calculations.
Only permitted 3 files (a .html, .css, and .js), with no major framework usage, just the basics here.

Must upload changes to Github/Gitlab, and have end result viewable on Heroku.

Completed and submitted on Jan 26. PHP and JSON files added solely to trick Heroku into thinking we're running a PHP app so it'll build it; they have no actual functionality.
